# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## For deliverable 1, there appears to be a steady rate in terms of vehicle length. Only one of the results had a vehicle length of 20 and nothing else. The same can be said about the ground clearance. The numbers are close apart but the rest of the data for the other categories fluctuate in value.
## As for deliverable 2, the mean, median, variance, and std_dev under total summary consists of one row. For lot summary, mean, median, variance and std_dev are all established and Manufacturing_Lot is a new column. The variance for lot 3 is exceedingly greater than than the variance for lots 1 and 2.







## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
### When analyzing the cost of the mecha car, usually a vehicle that costs high in value will perform well during competition. In terms of fuel efficiency, a car that runs well on fuel will perform well in a race. Safety is critical because if mechanical engineers do not test for safety, which is an important aspect of engineering, the car will have problems and the driver will put himself and other drivers at danger.                       A statistical test I would use to test the hypothesis would be a graph and a table because graphs can visually display your results and tables keep things organized for someone to observe. Total summary, lot summary, and the suspension coil data would be assets to run the statistical test. This was data that I had done during my challenge and I think they are important for determining factors of the competition.
